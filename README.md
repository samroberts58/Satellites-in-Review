## Introduction

The objective of this project is to identify competitors involved in satellite operations as they relate to Earth-focused missions. Differences between the factors, including owners/operators and satellite types are studied singularly and jointly to establish a multidimensional perspective on the status of satellite ownership and usage globally. 


## Data Set
The data set for this project is "Active Satellites in Orbit Around Earth" and posted by Union of Concerned Scientists on www.Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/ucsusa/active-satellites). 
<br/><br/>The original data set contained 1,420 rows and 26 variables. <br/>
The refined data set contained 1,397 rows and 22 variables.


## Project Design & Requirements
- Python 3.6 was used for data preprocessing to handle null values and remove unneeded variables.
- Excel was used for initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics reporting.
- Tableau visualizations were created for presentation visuals.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) were created to host the Tableau visuals in a web-based format.

* A user must sign into a Tableau Online account in order to view the Tableau graphs and charts embedded in the presentation framework.
